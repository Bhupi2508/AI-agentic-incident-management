*** Closure Validation â€” What It Does ***
 - This function checks if an incident is truly resolved by analyzing:

     - User feedback phrases indicating if the issue is fixed or still there.
     - System logs showing clean or error-filled system status.

 - How it works
     - Looks for positive patterns in feedback or logs (like "issue fixed", "no errors").
     - Looks for negative patterns suggesting ongoing problems (like "still seeing error", "crash detected").
     - Returns a clear message whether closure is validated, rejected, or needs more investigation.

 - Why it matters
     - It helps automate confirmation that a problem is resolved before closing a ticket or escalating further.
