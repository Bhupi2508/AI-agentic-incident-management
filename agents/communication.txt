*** Email Sending Module â€” What It Does ***

 - This script automatically sends incident update emails using AWS SES.
     - It loads settings like AWS region and email addresses from environment variables.
     - Takes these inputs:
         - Incident summary
         - Escalation message (e.g., "Escalated to Level 2 Support")
         - Resolution message

     - Builds a clear, emoji-friendly email body.
     - Sends the email via AWS SES to the right recipients.
     - Prints success or error info for monitoring.

How it fits in your system
 - After diagnosing and deciding the next steps for an incident, this module notifies stakeholders instantly by emailing the incident details and what actions were taken.
 - AWS SES handles the actual email delivery reliably, so your system just calls this function without worrying about email mechanics.
