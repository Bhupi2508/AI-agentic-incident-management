*** Escalation Module — What It Does ***

 - This module decides who to escalate an incident to based on its severity.
     - Takes the incident severity (e.g., Blocker, Critical, High).
     - Maps severity levels to escalation actions like:
         - Blocker → Platform Commander + Alert all stakeholders
         - Critical → SME (Subject Matter Expert)
         - High → Level 3 Support
     - Determines if escalation is needed or if automation can handle it.
     - Returns the escalation message and a flag indicating whether to escalate.

How it fits in your system
 - After diagnosing severity, your app uses this module to route incidents to the right team or automate responses, ensuring quick action from the correct people.

 - Next steps for improvement
     - Integrate with notification systems (Slack, PagerDuty).
     - Add more granular escalation levels.
     - Customize escalation rules per team or incident type.
