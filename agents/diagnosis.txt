*** Diagnosis Module â€” What It Does ***

 - This module analyzes an incident description using an AI model and returns:
     - The root cause of the incident.
     - Recommended next steps to fix it.
     - A confidence score estimating how sure the AI is.
     - The severity level of the incident (like High, Medium).
     - Whether human intervention is needed based on severity and confidence.

 - How it fits in your system
     - You send incident details to this module, it calls the AI model to get a structured diagnosis, then uses rules to evaluate how serious the issue is and if a human needs to step in.

 - Next steps for improvement
     - Enhance confidence scoring with more AI insights.
     - Add more detailed severity rules.
     - Support more complex incident descriptions.
