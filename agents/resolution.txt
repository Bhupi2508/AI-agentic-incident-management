*** Issue Resolver â€” What it does ***

 - Input: Takes a diagnosis result dictionary containing root_cause and next_steps.
 - Combines the root cause and next steps into one text string (lowercased).
 - Checks for specific keywords (like "restart", "config", "rollback", etc.) in the combined text using exact word matching.
 - Returns a predefined resolution message matching the first found keyword.
 - If no keywords match, it returns a default message asking for manual intervention.

 - Why useful?
     - Automates initial resolution suggestions based on diagnosis keywords, speeding up incident handling and guiding next steps.
